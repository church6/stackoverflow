## Automatically replace all try!() with `?`

If you've got code that still uses the try!() macro, you can quickly and accurately upgrade it to the ? 6 operator.

Create rules.rs file with:

fn rule1<T,E,X: From<E>>(r: Result<T,E>) -> Result<T,X> {
    replace!(r#try!(r) => r?);
    unreachable!()
}
Then run:

rustup update
cargo +nightly install rerast
cargo +nightly rerast --rules_file=rules.rs --force
and poof! the macro will be gone. Rerast 40 operates on the AST and fixes priorities of operations if necessary, so it's much smarter and more correct than textual find'n'replace.
